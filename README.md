Simple "To-Do list" application for Java

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pretty simple; run program and use directives to make a selection. With this, you can:

1. Add Task
2. Mark Task as done
3. Remove a task
4. Edit a task
5. Display list of all tasks

Program will remain active until user input 6 is given to terminate the program. No data is stored once user exits.

NOTE: This is for project purposes only.
